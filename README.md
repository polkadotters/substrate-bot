Substrate Bot
======================
Bot listens to the incoming blocks from the target chain and can submit extrinsics based on the events happening in
incoming blocks.

## Install

Make sure you install the required packages on whichever user will run the script, using the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
